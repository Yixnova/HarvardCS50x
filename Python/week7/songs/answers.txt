1. SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

The provided songlist of 100 songs, when sorted with the above query, gives the following results:

+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

The following characterization could be inferred from the above results:

While the listener'S energy and danceability levels are higher than the average listener,
the average valence ('happiness') score is just lower than average.
It could be inferred the listener enjoys faster, harder music with alternative, or potentially
even anti-social themes. This could include metal, heavy electronica and/or rap.

2. The above query omits much of the data provided in the list, leaving heavy speculation needed to make a characterization of the listener.
The following metrics could be used:
- Longer duration songs could indicate certain types of music, as would loudness, volume and key.
- High Speechiness could indicate a more rap-centric collection.
- High tempo could indicate more techno/electronic and/or hard rock/punk content.
